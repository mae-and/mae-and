## Hi there 👋

🫖 I'm Mae, a software engineer based in London, UK. 

✨ I'm a recent MSc Computer Science graduate with a passion for data and currently looking for a software engineer position. 

👩🏼‍💻 I love building applications that leverage the power of data and create user-centric solutions. I thrive off the challenge of crafting clean, efficient code and the thrill of uncovering insights from data. (Hence my pull to software engineering with a data focus)

🏂 Outside of work, you can catch me on the slopes or spending time in nature
